QUICK TEST STEPS FOR LOGIN FUNCTIONALITY
==========================================

IMPORTANT: Make sure the server is running!
  Command: cd 'C:\Users\admin\Downloads\building material'; node server.js

=== STEP 1: Open Debug Page ===
Go to: http://localhost:5000/debug_login.html

=== STEP 2: Create Test Buyer ===
Click button: "📝 Register Test Buyer (testbuyer@test.com)"
Wait for: ✅ Buyer registered!
Credentials: 
  - Email: testbuyer@test.com
  - Password: test123

=== STEP 3: Login ===
Click button: "🔐 Login as Buyer"
Wait for: ✅ Login successful! User: Test Buyer

=== STEP 4: Check Session ===
Click button: "📊 Check Current Session"
Wait for: ✅ Session found! User: Test Buyer (buyer)

=== STEP 5: Test Navbar Update ===
Click button: "🔨 Force Update Navbar"
Expected: ✅ Navbar updated! Changed to: Test Buyer

=== STEP 6: Go to Home Page ===
Open: http://localhost:5000/index.html
Look at navbar - should see "Test Buyer" instead of "Login" in GREEN

=== STEP 7: Test Other Pages ===
Click these to verify username persists:
- http://localhost:5000/cement.html
- http://localhost:5000/bricks.html
- http://localhost:5000/iron.html

All should show "Test Buyer" in the navbar.

=== STEP 8: Logout ===
Click the "Logout" link (appears next to username)
Page reloads...
Look at navbar - should now show "Login" again in BLUE

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
✅ After login, navbar shows user name (not "Login")
✅ After login, "Logout" link appears
✅ Username persists across pages
✅ After logout, navbar shows "Login" again

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If navbar doesn't update:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages starting with 🔍, 📊, ✅, or ❌
4. Check if you see "Session data: {success: true, user: ...}"
5. If not, session is not being sent/retrieved

If still not working:
1. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete browser cookies for http://localhost:5000
3. Start server again: node server.js
4. Try again from Step 1
